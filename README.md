# Installation

## How to install Ruby

First things first, make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed on your machine.

### Debian, Ubuntu

Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu use the apt package manager. You can use it like this:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```

### Windows Package Manager

On Windows, you can use the [Windows Package Manager CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) to install Ruby:

```shell
> winget install RubyInstallerTeam.Ruby
```

### macOS

Homebrew (macOS)
Ruby versions 2.0 and above are included by default in macOS releases since at least El Capitan (10.11).

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a commonly used package manager on macOS. Installing Ruby using Homebrew is easy:

```shell
$ brew install ruby
```

This should install the latest Ruby version.

List all the installed Ruby versions:

```shell
which -a ruby
# /usr/bin/ruby
```

Get information about currently used Ruby:

```shell
ruby -v
# ruby 2.6.3p62 (2019-04-16 revision 67580) [universal.arm64e-darwin20]
gem env
```

### Docker

In case you don’t want to install Ruby natively, you can use [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

```shell
docker run -it --rm ruby:latest
# check which version of Ruby you're running
RUBY_VERSION
```

Run a specific version of Ruby.

```shell
docker run -it --rm ruby:2.7
# check which version of Ruby you're running
RUBY_VERSION
```

### Install rbenv with package managers

rbenv is a version manager tool for the Ruby programming language on Unix-like systems.
It is useful for switching between multiple Ruby versions on the same machine and for
ensuring that each project you are working on always runs on the correct Ruby version.

[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#readme)

#### macOS

```shell
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

#### Debian, ubuntu and other derivatives

```shell
sudo apt install rbenv
```

Load rbenv

```shell
# run this and follow the printed instructions:
rbenv init
```

Restart terminal for the changes to take effect.

### Install ruby with rbenv

```shell
# list latest stable versions:
rbenv install -l

# list all local versions:
rbenv install -L

# install a Ruby version:
rbenv install 3.1.2

rbenv global 3.1.2   # set the default Ruby version for this machine
# or:
rbenv local 3.1.2    # set the Ruby version for this directory
rbenv local --unset

rbenv version # Displays the currently active Ruby version
=> 1.9.3-p327 (set by /Users/sam/.rbenv/version)
```

### Install ruby with RVM

RVM allows you to install and manage multiple installations of Ruby on your system.
It can also manage different gemsets. It is available for macOS, Linux, or other UNIX-like operating systems.

[RVM](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#rvm)

```shell
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
rvm list
rvm install 3.0.1
rvm list
rvm use 3.0.1
```

## How to install ruby gem manager, bundler gem

```
# access the bash for executing the following commands
docker run -it --rm ruby:latest bash
```

```
gem install bundler
bundle -v
gem update bundler
gem uninstall bundler
```

[Further reading](https://bundler.io/)

## What is a Gemfile and Gemfile.lock

Gemfile is a configuration file for Bundler (also a gem), which contains a list of gems for your project (dependencies).

[Further reading](https://bundler.io/v2.0/man/gemfile.5.html)

```
# specify your gems in a Gemfile in your project’s root
ruby '2.5.6'

source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'nokogiri'
gem 'rack', '~>1.1'
gem 'rspec', :require => 'spec'
```

```bash
# install all the gems in the Gemfile
bundle install
```

## How to install a specific version of a particular ruby gem

```bash
gem install bundler -v 1.17
gem install minitest -v 5.8.4
```

## How to update a single gem using Bundler

```bash
bundle update nokogiri
```

Bundler attempted to update `gem_name` but its version stayed the same.

1. Another gem depends on the `gem_name`.
2. The version number is specified in your Gemfile for `gem_name`.

```
'gem_name', '~> 2.0.5'
```

## How to update every gem in the Gemfile using Bundler

```bash
bundle update
```

# Introduction

Ruby is a pure object-oriented and interpreted (executes the code at runtime) programming language invented in the mid-90s by [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://github.com/matz). In Ruby, everything is an object.
It is easy to learn with dynamic typing and automatic memory management.

With the idea that programming should be enjoyable for programmers, it was created to increase programmer
productivity. It emphasizes the necessity for software to be understood by humans first and computers second.

Ruby will be quite familiar to Python, and Perl developers (and to a lesser extent C# and JavaScript developers) as Ruby was heavily inspired by Perl in certain areas (as was Python).
Ruby is less related to languages like C, C++, or Java because these languages are compiled (not interpreted), statically typed, and focused on performance rather than flexibility and
conciseness.

Ruby comes with a program that will show the results of any Ruby statements
you feed it. Playing with Ruby code in interactive sessions like this is a
terrific way to learn the language.

Open up IRB (which stands for Interactive Ruby).

-   If you’re using **macOS** open up `Terminal` and type `irb`, then hit enter.
-   If you’re using **Linux**, open up a `shell` and type `irb` and hit enter.
-   If you’re using **Windows**, open `Interactive Ruby` from the Ruby section
    of your Start Menu.

```ruby
1.next # 2
```

To test the above code, type the irb command from your shell to initiate the interpreter.

# Comment

```ruby
# single line comment

=begin
multiline
comment
=end

=begin Comment line 1 =end

puts "Hello world!"  # Inline comment about the code

```

We put a space between the contents of the comment & the start of the comment to make
it easier to read.

I prefer `#` for multiline comments because it maintains my style guide and is easier to read.

# Variables and Scope

There are five different types of variables. The first character determines the scope.

| No  | Name        | Scope             | Example                    | Note                                                                                               |

| 2   | @           | instance variable | @id = []                   | Instance variables have the `nil` value until they are initialized.                                |
| 3   | @@          | class variable    | @@name = []                | Class variable must be initialized.                                                                |
| 4   | $           | global variable   | $version = "0.8.9"         | Global variables have the `nil` value until they are initialized.                                  |
| 5   | [A-Z]       | constant          | PI = 3.14                  | Constant variables must be initialized and you can change the constant but you will get a warning. |

## Local Variable

Local variables are available to the block in which they are declared.
A local variable declared within a loop or method cannot be accessed outside
of that loop or method. They must either begin with an underscore or lowercase letter.

```ruby
current_weather = "rainy"
_weather = "sunny"
```

Scope of a local variable is one of

-   proc{ ... }
-   loop{ ... }
-   def ... end
-   class ... end
-   module ... end
-   the entire program (unless one of the above applies)

## Instance Variable

Instance variable is specific instance of an object. Changes to an instance variable are only
available to that instance of the object. Instance variables are declared with a single @ sign.

```ruby
@current_weather = "rainy"
```

Scope of an instance variable is

Instance variables cannot be altered except for some methods,
and it's distinct to each object of a class.

## Class Variable

Class variables are shared by all instances of a Ruby class.
If one object instance changes the value of a class variable,
that new value will essentially change for all other object instances.
Class variables begin with a double @ sign.

```ruby
@@current_weather = "rainy"
```

Scope of a class variable is one of

It can be called from a class by calling ClassName.class_variable,
and it's independent of any object of a class.

## Global Variable

Global variables in Ruby are accessible anywhere in the Ruby program,
regardless of where they are declared. Global variable names must
begin with a dollar sign ($).

The use of global variables is discouraged because they are visible
anywhere in the code for a program and can be changed from anywhere
in a program. This can make tracking down bugs extremely difficult.

```ruby
$current_weather = "rainy"
```

Scope of a global variable is

It can be referred from anywhere in a program.

## Constant Variable

Ruby constants are variables which, once assigned a value, shouldn't be changed.
Constant declared outside of a class or module have global scope.
If they are declared inside a class or module, they are available within
the context of the class or module in which they were declared.

```ruby
WEATHER = "rainy".freeze
```

Scope of a constant variable is

Accessible outside the class.

## Pseudo variables

| No  | Name       | Note                                               |
| --- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | self       | The receiver object of the current method          |
| 2   | true       | Instance of the TrueClass                          |
| 3   | false      | Instance of the FalseClass                         |
| 4   | nil        | Instance of the NilClass                           |
| 5   | `__FILE__` | The name of current source file name               |
| 6   | `__LINE__` | The current line number of the current source file |

## Pre-defined variables

| No  | Name       | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

(Mnemonic: ' often follows a quoted string.)                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6   | $+         | The last bracket matched by the last successful search pattern, or nil if the last pattern match failed. This is useful if you don't know which of a set of alternative patterns matched. (Mnemonic: be positive and forward looking.)                                                                                                                                           |
| 7   | $1, $2...  | Contains the subpattern from the corresponding set of parentheses in the last successful pattern matched, not counting patterns matched in nested blocks that have been exited already, or nil if the last pattern match failed. (Mnemonic: like \digit.) These variables are all read-only.                                                                                     |
| 8   | $~         | The information about the last match in the current scope. Setting this variables affects the match variables like `$&, $+, $1, $2..` etc. The nth subexpression can be retrieved by $~[nth]. (Mnemonic: ~ is for match.) This variable is locally scoped.                                                                                                                       |
| 9   | $=         | The flag for case insensitive, nil by default. (Mnemonic: = is for comparison.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 10  | $/         | The input record separator, newline by default. Works like awk's RS variable. If it is set to nil, whole file will be read at once. (Mnemonic: / is used to delimit line boundaries when quoting poetry.)                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11  | $\         | The output record separator for the print and IO#write. The default is nil. (Mnemonic: It's just like /, but it's what you get "back" from Ruby.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12  | $,         | The output field separator for the print. Also, it is the default separator for Array#join. (Mnemonic: what is printed when there is a , in your print statement.)                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 13  | $;         | The default separator for String#split.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 14  | $.         | The current input line number of the last file that was read.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15  | $<         | The virtual concatenation file of the files given by command line arguments, or stdin (in case no argument file supplied). `$<.file` returns the current filename. (Mnemonic: `$<` is a shell input source.)                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 16  | $>         | The default output for `print`, `printf`. `$stdout` by default. (Mnemonic: `$>` is for shell output.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 17  | $\_        | The last input line of String by gets or readline. It is set to nil if gets/readline meet EOF. This variable is locally scoped. (Mnemonic: partly same as Perl.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 17  | $0         | Contains the name of the file containing the Ruby script being executed. On some operating systems assigning to $0 modifies the argument area that the ps(1) program sees. This is more useful as a way of indicating the current program state than it is for hiding the program you're running. (Mnemonic: same as sh and ksh.)                                                |
| 18  | $\*        | Command line arguments given for the script. The options for Ruby interpreter are already removed.

| 21  | $:         | The array contains the list of places to look for Ruby scripts and binary modules by load or require. It initially consists of the arguments to any `-I` command line switches, followed by the default Ruby library, probabl `"/usr/local/lib/ruby"`, followed by `"."`, to represent the current directory. (Mnemonic: colon is the separators for PATH environment variable.) |
| 22  | $"         | The array contains the module names loaded by require. Used for prevent require from load modules twice. (Mnemonic: prevent files to be doubly quoted(loaded).)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The variables which names are in the form of $-?, where ? is the option character,
are called option variables and contains the information about interpreter command
line options.

| No  | Name | Note                                                                                                                                |

## How to check scope of variables

```ruby
defined? count
"local-variable"
defined? @id
"instance-variable"
defined? @@name
"class variable"
defined? $version
"global-variable"
defined? PI
"constant"
```

# Conditional structures

## if Modifier

```ruby
num = 2
puts 'two' if num == 2
```

Executes code if the conditional is true.

## If elsif else Statement

```ruby
temp = 19

if temp >= 25
  puts "hot"
elsif temp < 25 && temp >= 18
  puts "normal"
else
  puts "cold"
end

# output
# normal
```

`if` expressions are used for conditional execution.
The values `false` and `nil` are `false`, and everything else are `true`.
Notice Ruby uses `elsif`, not `else if` nor `elif`.

Executes code if the conditional is `true`. If the conditional is not `true`, code specified in the `else` clause is executed.

An `if` expression's conditional is separated from code by the reserved word then, a newline, or a semicolon.

## unless Statement

```ruby
# The unless is opposite of if, evaluates when the statement is false

name = "rob"

# if name != "bob"
unless name == "bob"
  puts "hello stranger"
else
  puts "hello bob"
end
# output
# hello stranger

num = 6
puts 'not two' unless num == 2
# output
# not two
```

Executes code if conditional is `false`. If the conditional is `true`, code specified in the else clause is executed.

## Case Statements

```ruby
# case returns the value of the last expression executed

case input
# check an integer, 19
when 19
  puts "It's 19"
  # check a float number, 33.3
when 33.3
  puts "It's 33.3"
  # check an exact string, "Zaman"
when "Zaman"
  puts "Hi Zaman"
when 10
  puts "It's 10"
  # check against a range
when 7..11
  puts "It's between 7 and 11"
  # check against multiple values, "coffee"
when "tea", "coffee"
  puts "Happy days"
  # check against a regular expression, "aA6"
when /^a[A-Z]+[0-6]+$/
  puts "It's a valid match"
  # check any string by comparing against the String class, "any string"
when String
  puts "It's a String"
end

# using short syntax
case input
  when 19 then puts "It's 19"
end

# optional fallthrough
case input
  when 19 then puts "It's 19"
else
  puts "It's not 19"
end

# get the return value
marks = 86

result = case marks
         when 0..49 then "Fail"
         when 50..64 then "Pass"
         when 65..74 then "Credit"
         when 75..84 then "Distinction"
         when 85..100 then "High Distinction"
         else "Invalid marks"
         end

puts result
# High Distinction
```

Compares the expression specified by case and that specified by when using the === operator and executes the code of
the when clause that matches.

The expression specified by the when clause is evaluated as the left operand. If no when clauses match, case executes
the code of the else clause.

A when statement's expression is separated from code by the reserved word then, a newline, or a semicolon.

# Data types

Data types represent different types of data such as numbers,
booleans, strings, etc. As an object-oriented language,
all data types are based on classes.

| No  | Type    | Example                      | Class                                              | Doc                                 |
| --- | ------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1   | Integer | a = 17                       | a.class > Integer <br>a.class.superclass > Numeric | [link][2]                           |
| 2   | Float   | a = 87.23                    | a.class > Float <br>a.class.superclass > Numeric   | [link][3]                           |
| 3   | String  | a = "Hello universe"         | a.class > String                                   | [link][4]                           |
| 4   | Array   | a = [12, 34]                 | a.class > Array                                    | [link][5]                           |
| 5   | Hash    | a = {type: "tea", count: 10} | a.class > Hash                                     | [link][6]                           |
| 6   | Boolean | a = false<br>a = true        | a.class > FalseClass <br>a.class > TrueClass       | [TrueClass][7] <br> [FalseClass][8] |
| 7   | Symbol  | a = :status                  | a.class > Symbol                                   | [link][9]                           |
| 8   | Nil     | a = nil                      | a.class > NilClass                                 | [link][11]                          |

## Integer

In Ruby, Integer class is the basis for the two concrete classes that hold whole numbers. These concrete classes are
Bignum and Fixnum. Fixnum holds integer values that are shown in the native machine word, whereas Bignum holds the
integer value outside the range of Fixnum. Integer class contains a wide range of methods that are used for performing
specified tasks. Integer class is a subclass of Numeric class.

## Float

Float objects represent inexact real numbers using the native architecture's double-precision floating point
representation.

## String

A string is a group of letters that represent a sentence or a word. Strings are defined by enclosing a text within a
single (') or double (") quotes. You can use both double quotes and single quotes to create strings. Strings are objects
of class String. Double-quoted strings allow substitution and backslash notation but single-quoted strings doesn't
allow substitution and allow backslash notation only for \\ and \’.

## Array

An array stores data or list of data. It can contain all types of data. Data in an array are separated by comma in
between them and are enclosed within square bracket.The position of elements in an array starts with 0. A trailing comma
is ignored.

## Hash

A hash assign its values to its key. Value to a key is assigned by => sign. A key pair is separated with a comma between
them and all the pairs are enclosed within curly braces. A hash in Ruby is like an object literal in JavaScript or an
associative array in PHP. They’re made similarly to arrays. A trailing comma is ignored.

## Boolean

Boolean data type represents only one bit of information either true or false.

## Symbol

Symbols are light-weight strings. A symbol is preceded by a colon (:). They are used instead of strings because they can
take up much less memory. Symbols have better performance.

## How to check the data type

```ruby
# both are synonymous
a = 37
a.kind_of? Integer
# true
a.is_a? Integer
# true
```

# Symbol

Symbol objects represent names. Symbols are immutable, which means every symbol is unique, and we can't change it.
Referencing the same symbol multiple times is the same as referencing the same object everywhere in your program.
As a result, we can save both time and memory by referencing the same memory location. Symbols as hash keys.

```ruby
week_days = {sunday: 11, monday: 222}
```

# String

## String Interpolation

String interpolation allows you to combine strings together:

```ruby
name = "World"
puts "Hello #{name}"

puts "The total is #{1+1}"
# "the total is 2"
```

## How to Extract a Substring

A substring is a smaller part of a string, it’s useful if you only want that specific part,
like the beginning, middle, or end.

```ruby

string = "abc123"
string[0,3]
# "abc"

string[3,3]
# "123"

string[0..-2]
# "abc12"

#remove or replace the substring
string[0..2] = ""
puts string
# "123"
```

## How to convert String to lower or upper case

| No  | Method name | Output                                          |
| --- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | downcase    | `"HELLO World".downcase` <br> `"hello world"`   |
| 2   | upcase      | `"hello worlD".upcase` <br> `"HELLO WORLD"`     |
| 3   | capitalize  | `"hEllo wOrlD".capitalize` <br> `"Hello world"` |
| 4   | swapcase    | `"hEllo WOrlD".swapcase` <br> `"HeLLO woRLd"`   |

Ranges allow us to declare data with a beginning and an end, it has two operators to generate ranges.

```ruby
# .. for creating inclusive ranges

range = 1..10
range.to_a
# output

```

```ruby
# ... for creating exclusive ranges

range = 1...10
range.to_a
# output
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

# Methods

A method is a function that takes zero or more parameters and returns a value.
Ruby method returns nil by default.

Method names should begin with a lowercase letter. If you begin a method name with an uppercase letter,
Ruby might think that it is a constant and hence can parse the call incorrectly.

Methods should be defined before calling them, otherwise Ruby will raise an exception for undefined method invoking.

## How to declare a method

In Ruby, the last statement evaluated is the return value of that method. The return statement is optional. Depending on your preference, you can choose either of them 👍.
I prefer to use the return statement because it's easier to understand.

```ruby
def method_name(parameter1, parameter2)
    puts "#{parameter1} #{parameter2}"
    parameter1 + parameter2
end

res = method_name(20, 10)
# output
# 30
```

```ruby
def method_name(parameter1, parameter2)
    puts "#{parameter1} #{parameter2}"
    return parameter1 + parameter2
end
# output
# 30
```

## How to call a method

```ruby
res = method_name(parameter1, parameter2)
# In Ruby you can call methods without parentheses
res = method_name parameter1, parameter2
```

The most important drawback to using methods with parameters
is that you need to remember the number of parameters whenever
you call such methods. For example, if a method accepts three
parameters and you pass only two, then Ruby displays an error.

## How to define a default value for a method parameter

```ruby
def method_name(parameter1, parameter2, type = "ADD")
  puts "#{parameter1} #{parameter2}"
  return parameter1 + parameter2 if type == "ADD"
  return parameter1 - parameter2 if type == "SUB"
end

res = method_name(20, 10)
# output
# 30
```

## How to use another parameter for the default value

```ruby
def method_name(num1, num2 = num1)
  return num1 + num2
end

res = method_name(10)
# output
# 20
```

## How to pass variable length argument to a method parameter

```ruby
def method_name(type, *values)
  return values.reduce(:+) if type == "ADD"
  return values.reduce(:-) if type == "SUB"
end

numbers = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]

res = method_name("ADD", *numbers)
# output
# 15

res = method_name("SUB", *numbers)
# output
# -11

# or you can provide the values like this
res = method_name("ADD", 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)
# output
# 15
```

## Modify object

The `!` is used after the method when you want to modify the object.

```
a = ["Drama",
"Mystery",
"Crime",
"Sci-fi",
"Disaster",
"Thriller"]
a.sort
puts a
# we didn't modify the object
# Drama
# Mystery
# Crime
# Sci-fi
# Disaster
# Thriller

a.sort!
puts a
# modify the object
# Crime
# Disaster
# Drama
# Mystery
# Sci-fi
# Thriller
```

## Boolean method

In ruby methods that end with a question mark (?) are called boolean methods, which either returns true or false.

```ruby
"some text".nil?
# false
nil.nil?
# true
```

You can have your own boolean methods.

```ruby
def is_vowel?(char)
  ['a','e','i','o','u'].include? char
end

is_vowel? 'a'
# true
is_vowel? 'b'
# false
```

## Class method

A class method is a class-level method. There are multiple ways of defining a class method.

When a method is defined outside of the class definition, the method is marked as private by default. On the other hand,
the methods defined in the class definition are marked as public by default. The default visibility and the private mark
of the methods can be changed by public or private of the Module.

Whenever you want to access a method of a class, you first need to instantiate the class. Then, using the object,
you can access any member of the class.

Ruby gives you a way to access a method without instantiating a class.
Let us see how a class method is declared and accessed −

```ruby
class Mobile
  def self.ring
    "ring ring ring..."
  end
end

Mobile.ring
```

```ruby
class Mobile
  def Mobile.ring
    "ring ring ring..."
  end
end

Mobile.ring
```

```ruby
class Mobile
  class << self
    def ring
      "ring ring ring..."
    end
  end
end

Mobile.ring
```

To access this method, you need not create objects of the class Mobile.

A class method is an instance method of the class object. When a new class is created, an object of type `Class` is
initialized and assigned to a global constant (Mobile in this case).

```ruby
Mobile = Class.new do
  def self.ring
    "ring ring ring..."
  end
end

Mobile.ring
```

```ruby
Mobile = Class.new

class << Mobile
  def ring
      "ring ring ring..."
  end
end

Mobile.ring
```

# Blocks

In Ruby, a block is a piece of code that can be passed as an argument to a method, and is executed by the method at a
later time. Blocks are defined using the keywords "do" and "end" or using curly braces {}. They can also be passed
using the "yield" keyword within a method. They are commonly used in iterators such as "each" and "map" to perform an
operation on each element of a collection. A block returns the last evaluated statement.

Blocks in Ruby have a few key aspects that are significant:

1. Block can accept arguments and returns a value.
2. Block does not have their own name.
3. Block consist of chunks of code.
4. A block is always invoked with a function or can say passed to a method call.
5. To call a block within a method with a value, yield statement is used.
6. Blocks can be called just like methods from inside the method that it is passed to.



```ruby
# return value
def give_me_data
  data = yield
  puts "data = #{data}"
end

give_me_data { "Big data" }

# output
# data = Big data
```

```ruby
# single line block
salary = [399, 234, 566, 533, 233]
salary.each { |s| puts s }

# puts s = block body
# |s| = block arugments
```

```ruby
# multiline block
salary.each do |s|
  a = 10
  res = a * s
  puts res
end

# block body
# a = 10
# res = a * s
# puts res

# block arugments
# |s|
```

Methods can take blocks implicitly and explicitly. If you want to call a block implicitly use the `yield` keyword.
Yield finds the block and calls the passed block. Since you can pass implicit blocks, you don't have to call yield, and the block will be ignored.

```ruby
# passing a block implicitly
def give_me_data
  puts "I am inside give_me_data method"
  yield
  puts "I am back in give_me_data method"
end

give_me_data { puts "Big data" }

# output
# I am inside give_me_data method
# Big data
# I am back in give_me_data method

# call multiple times
def give_me_data
  yield
  yield
  yield
end

give_me_data { puts "Big data" }

# output
# Big data
# Big data
# Big data

# call with block arguments

def give_me_data
  yield 10
  yield 100
  yield 30
end

give_me_data { |data| puts "Big data #{data} TB" }

# output
# Big data 10 TB
# Big data 100 TB
# Big data 30 TB

# call with multiple block arguments

def give_me_data
  yield "Big data", 10, "TB"
  yield "Big data", 100, "GB"
  yield "Big data", 30, "MB"
end

give_me_data { |text, data, unit| puts "#{text} #{data} #{unit}" }

# output
# Big data 10 TB
# Big data 100 GB
# Big data 30 MB

#  block will try to return from the current context
give_me_data
  puts "I am inside give_me_data method"
end

def test
  puts "I am inside test method"
  give_me_data { return 10 } # code returns from here
  puts "I am back in test method"
end

return_value = test

# output
# I am inside test method
# I am inside give_me_data method
# 10
```

```ruby
# passing a block explicitly by using an ampersand parameter, here we are explicitly defining the method with block parameter and calling it
def give_me_data(&block)
  block.call
  block.call
end

give_me_data { puts "Big data" }

# output
# Big data
# Big data
```

## How to check if a block is given

Block parameter is mandatory when you call yield inside a method; otherwise, it will raise an exception

```ruby
def give_me_data
  yield
end

give_me_data

# output
# LocalJumpError: no block given (yield)

# you can use block_given? method to handle the exception and make the block optional

def give_me_data
  return "no block" unless block_given?
  yield
end

give_me_data { puts "Big data" }
give_me_data

# output
# Big data

def give_me_data(&block)
  block.call if block
end

give_me_data { puts "Big data" }
give_me_data

# output
# Big data
```

# Procs

In Ruby, a **proc** (short for "**procedure**") is a way to package a block of code as an object, which can be passed around and reused like any other object in Ruby.
This allows you to define a block of code once and use it in multiple places, rather than having to repeat the same code multiple times.

The benefits of using Procs include:

* **Reus-ability:** Since a Proc is an object, it can be stored in a variable and passed as an argument to a method, allowing it to be used in multiple places throughout your code.
* **Flexibility:** Procs can be used in a variety of situations where a block is accepted, such as in iterators, callbacks, and event handlers.
* **Clarity:** Procs can help to make your code more readable by encapsulating complex logic into a single, named object
that can be easily understood.

Procs can be created by passing a block to the Proc.new or lambda methods, or by using
the shorthand notation: `my_proc = proc {puts "Hello, World!"}` and `my_proc.call` can be used to invoke the proc


```ruby
p = Proc.new { puts "Hello World" }

def give_me_data(proc)
  proc.call
end

give_me_data p

# output
# Hello World

# arbitrary arguments
p = Proc.new { |count| "Hello World " * count }

def give_me_data(proc)
  proc.call 5, 2
end

give_me_data p

# output
# "Hello World Hello World Hello World Hello World Hello World "

#  proc will try to return from the current context
p = Proc.new { return 10 }
p.call

# output
LocalJumpError: unexpected return

# because you can’t return from the top-level context

def give_me_data
  puts "I am inside give_me_data method"
  p = Proc.new { return 10 }
  p.call # code returns from here
  puts "I am back in give_me_data method"
end

return_value = give_me_data
puts return_value

# output
# I am inside give_me_data method
# 10
```

# Lambdas

Lambdas are a powerful feature of the Ruby language. They allow you to wrap logic and data into a portable package.
A lambda function encapsulates control flow, parameters and local variables into a single package assigned to a variable
or used inline. If assigned to a variable, it can be passed to other functions or stored in data structures, just like a
more typical variable containing a string or float.

A lambda function can then be executed far from the code location where it was defined. Lambda functions are often
called anonymous functions or a function literal, wrap the lambda with `do and end` (for multiline) or curly brackets
`{ and }` (for a single line). Lambda returns the last evaluated statement.

With Ruby, the **lambda** keyword is used to create a lambda function. It requires a block and can define zero or more parameters.
You call the resulting lambda function by using the call method.

The following are specific situations in which you might want to use a Ruby lambda.

1. Encapsulating complicated logic
2. An in-memory state machine or data pipeline
3. Perfect for simple callbacks
4. Used in ActiveRecord scopes

In Ruby, a lambda is a type of Proc that has some specific characteristics and behaviors. Like a Proc, a lambda is a way
to package a block of code as a object that can be passed around and reused, but there are some differences between the two.

The main difference between a lambda and a proc is in the way they handle the "return" keyword. In a proc, the "return"
keyword will return from the method that the proc was defined in, whereas in a lambda, the "return" keyword will only
return from the lambda itself.

The benefits of using a lambda include:

* **Clarity:** Like procs, using a lambda can help to make your code more readable by encapsulating complex logic into
a single, named object that can be easily understood.
* **Strictness:** Since Lambdas are more strict in terms of how they handle the return keyword, it can be beneficial
in cases where you want to ensure that a block of code behaves in a specific way.
* **Strict number of arguments:** Lambdas also check the number of arguments passed to them, unlike procs which don't
check the number of arguments passed to them.

```ruby
# there are multiple ways to declare a lambda
l = lambda { puts "Hello World" }
# shorthand
l = -> { puts "Hello World" }

# call the lambda
l.call

# output
# Hello World

# there are multiple ways you can call a lambda
l.()
l[]

# strict arguments
l = -> (count) { "Hello World " * count }
l.call 5

# output
# "Hello World Hello World Hello World Hello World Hello World "

l.call 5, 2

# output
wrong number of arguments (given 2, expected 1)

# lambdas return from the lambda itself, like a regular method
l = -> { return 10 }
l.call

# output
# 10

def give_me_data
  puts "I am inside give_me_data method"
  l = -> { return 10 }
  l.call
  puts "I am back in give_me_data method"
end

return_value = give_me_data
puts return_value

# output
# I am inside give_me_data method
# I am back in give_me_data method
# nil # because puts return nil
```

In summary, procs are more flexible and forgiving in their behavior, while lambdas are more strict and predictable.
It depends on the specific use-case and the desired behavior of the code.

# Blocks VS Procs VS Lambdas

All of them are used for executing a single line or multiline code.

| Name    | Object | Example                             | Object type                                 | When to use                                                                                                                                |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Blocks  | No     | { puts "Hello World" }              | -                                           | 1. when you want to pass blocks of code to a methods <br> 2. arbitrary arguments <br> 3. blocks return from the current method             |
| Procs   | Yes    | p = Proc.new { puts "Hello World" } | p.class <br> Proc <br> p.lambda? <br> false | 1. similar to blocks but can be stored in variables <br> 2. arbitrary arguments <br> 3. Procs return from the current method               |
| Lambdas | Yes    | l = lambda { puts "Hello World" }   | l.class <br> Proc <br> l.lambda? <br> true  | 1. it's a proc but acts like methods and can be stored in variables <br> 2. strict arguments <br> 3. lambdas return from the lambda itself |

# Array

Unlike other programming languages like Java, Ruby only has dynamic arrays
but no static arrays. That means you don’t have to worry about the size of
the array while adding new values.

One way Ruby allows you to represent a collection of data is with arrays,
which you can think of as ordered lists. Rather than working with individual
variables, numbers, or strings, an array allows you to create and manipulate
an ordered and indexed collection of these data.

The individual variables, numbers, or strings within an array are known
as elements.

An array can contain any combination of variables, numbers, strings, or other
Ruby objects (including other arrays), although it is advisable to keep similar
data types in any one array.

There are multiple ways we can initialize an empty array.

```ruby
array = Array.new   #=> []
# or
array = []

# An Array can contain different types of objects.
array = [1, "two", 3.0] #=> [1, "two", 3.0]

```

Fill an array with the initial size and a default object.

```ruby

numbers = Array.new(3)            #=> [nil, nil, nil]
numbers = Array.new(3, 7)         #=> [7, 7, 7]
numbers = Array.new(3, true)      #=> [true, true, true]

numbers = []
numbers.fill(7, 0..2)   #=> [7, 7, 7]
```

How about an array with different hashes? No problem, Ruby has you covered!

```ruby
array_with_hashes = Array.new(2) { {} } #=> [{}, {}]
array_with_hashes[0][:name] = "Bob"
array_with_hashes[0][:id] = 10          #=> [{:name=>"Bob", :id=>10}, {}]
```

Let’s talk about 2D arrays briefly.

```ruby
temperature_data = [
                     ["A908", 38],
                     ["A909", 37],
                     ["A910", 38],
                   ]
temperature_data[0]    #=> ["A908", 38]
temperature_data[0][0] #=> "A908"
temperature_data[0][1] #=> 38
```

Array indexing starts at 0. A negative index is relative to the end of the array,
so -1 is the last element of the array, -2 is the second last element in the array,
and so on.

```ruby
str_array = ["This", "is", "a", "small", "array"]
str_array[0]            #=> "This"
str_array[1]            #=> "is"
str_array[4]            #=> "array"

# A negative index is an offset, backwards, from the end of the array:

# Index -1 indicates the last element.
str_array[-1]             #=> "array"

# Index -2 indicates the next-to-last element.
str_array[-2]             #=> "small"

# A negative index is in range if its absolute value is
# not larger than the size of the array.

str_array[-6]             #=> nil

# str_array.at
puts str_array.at(0)      #=> "This"

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
arr[100]                  #=> nil
arr[-3]                   #=> 4
arr[2, 3]                 #=> [3, 4, 5]
arr[1..4]                 #=> [2, 3, 4, 5]
arr[1..-3]                #=> [2, 3, 4]

# To raise an error for indices outside of the array bounds
# or else to provide a default value when that happens, you can use fetch.

arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
arr.fetch(100)            #=> IndexError: index 100 outside of array bounds: -6...6
arr.fetch(100, "oops")    #=> "oops"


arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# The special methods first and last will return the first and last elements of an array
arr.first                #=> 1
arr.last                 #=> 6

# To return the first n elements of an array, use take
arr.take(3)             #=> [1, 2, 3]

# drop does the opposite of take, by returning the elements
# after n elements have been dropped
arr.drop(3)            #=> [4, 5, 6]

```

Add values at the end of the array.

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
numbers.push(11)          #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
numbers.push(12, 13, 14)  #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
```

Remove value from the end of the array.

```ruby
num_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
num_array.pop             #=> 10
num_array                 #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Add values at the start of the array.

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
numbers.unshift(0)          #=> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
numbers.unshift(-3, -2, -1) #=> [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

To retrieve and at the same time remove the first item, use shift:

```ruby
numbers.shift #=> 1
numbers       #=> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

To delete an element at a particular index:

```ruby
numbers.delete_at(2) #=> 4
numbers              #=> [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

To delete a particular element anywhere in an array, use delete:

```ruby
numbers.delete(2) #=> 2
numbers           #=> [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Insert values at the given index.

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
numbers.insert(0, 0)           #=> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
numbers.insert(0, -3, -2, -1)  #=> [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

numbers.insert(-1, 12, 13, 14) #=> [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14]
numbers.insert(-4, 11)         #=> [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
```

How about a block to populate the values of an array?

```ruby
numbers = Array.new(10) { |n| n = n * 2 } #=> [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
```

It gets easier to fill an array.

```ruby
numbers = Array(100..110) #=> [100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110]

# or we can convert a range to an array
(100..110).to_a #=> [100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110]

```

A useful method if you need to remove nil values from an array is compact:

```ruby
arr = ['foo', 0, nil, 'bar', 7, 'baz', nil]
arr.compact  #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']
arr          #=> ['foo', 0, nil, 'bar', 7, 'baz', nil]
arr.compact! #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']
arr          #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']

```

Another common need is to remove duplicate elements from an array.

It has the non-destructive uniq, and destructive method uniq!

```ruby
arr = [2, 5, 6, 556, 6, 6, 8, 9, 0, 123, 556]
arr.uniq #=> [2, 5, 6, 556, 8, 9, 0, 123]

```

## How to iterate an Array

There are multiple ways you can iterate an Array.

| No  | Name             | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | each             | when you want to just iterate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2   | each_with_index  | when you want both index and value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3   | each_with_object | when you want to build a hash or reduce a collection to one object. It Iterates the given block for each element with an arbitrary object given and returns the first given object. It only works with a mutable object like Hash but not an immutable object like integer |
| 4   | each_index       | when you want just the indexes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5   | map              | returns an array containing the values returned by the block                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

# Hash

A Hash maps each of its unique keys to a specific value. But it has certain similarities to an Array, but an Array index is always an Integer. A Hash key can be (almost) any object.

Let's start with some basic operations. Below we have an example of how to initialize an empty hash.

```ruby
students = Hash.new
or
students = {}
```

Here we have an empty hash, without any key-value pairs. Now the question is, what if someone wants to access a key that does not exist in the hash? Well, the answer is nil, which is the default value.

```ruby
puts "#{students[:name]}"
# nil
```

Let’s add some values to the hash using symbols. There are two ways to declare symbols as keys.

```ruby
students = Hash.new
students = { name: 'John', email: 'john@col.com' }
puts "#{students[:name]}"
# or
students = Hash.new
students = { :name => 'John', :email => 'john@col.com' }
puts "#{students[:name]}"
```

I prefer the former one because I’ve to type less! How about initializing with default values, here we have initialized an empty hash with a default value of “no email” for every key.

```ruby
students = Hash.new("no data")
puts "#{students[:email]}"
# no email
# or
students = Hash.new
students.default = "no data"
puts "#{students[:email]}"
# no email
```

The Hash.new() creates a single default object for every key. That’s why by altering it for one key changes for other keys as well. For example, when we change the default value for the key id, it affects other unassigned key’s default value, in this case, name.

```ruby
students = Hash.new("no data")
students[:email] = "john@col.com"
puts "#{students[:email]}"
# john@col.com
puts "#{students[:id]}"
# no data
puts "#{students[:name]}"
# no data
students[:id].upcase!
puts "#{students[:email]}"
# john@col.com
puts "#{students[:id]}"
# NO DATA
puts "#{students[:name]}"
# NO DATA
```

If the above code behavior is not desired, you can use Hash.new {|hash, key| block } instead. This method creates a default object each time for different keys.

```ruby
students = Hash.new {|hash, key| hash[key] = "no data" }
students[:email] = "john@col.com"
puts "#{students[:email]}"
# john@col.com
puts "#{students[:id]}"
# no data
puts "#{students[:name]}"
# no data
students[:id].upcase!
puts "#{students[:email]}"
# john@col.com
puts "#{students[:id]}"
# NO DATA
puts "#{students[:name]}"
# no data
```

In short, Hash.new(some_value) sets a default value of some_value for every key that does not exist in the hash, Hash.new {|hash, key| block } creates a new default object for every key that does not exist in the hash, and Hash.new() or {} sets nil for every key.

## How to group by count

```ruby
numbers = [1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 65, 55, 54, 55]
freq_hash = numbers.each_with_object(Hash.new(0)) { |number, hash| hash[number] += 1 }
puts "#{freq_hash}"
# output
# {1=>3, 2=>1, 4=>1, 65=>1, 55=>2, 54=>1}
```

or

```ruby
numbers = [1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 65, 55, 54, 55]
freq_hash = Hash.new(0)
numbers.each { |number| freq_hash[number] += 1 }
puts "#{freq_hash}"
# output
# {1=>3, 2=>1, 4=>1, 65=>1, 55=>2, 54=>1}
```

or from Ruby 2.7+

```ruby
numbers = [1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 65, 55, 54, 55]
numbers.tally
# output
# {1=>3, 2=>1, 4=>1, 65=>1, 55=>2, 54=>1}
```

## What's the difference between Hash.new(0) and {}

```ruby
# Hash.new(0) sets a default value of 0 for every key that do not exist in the hash.
# {} or Hash.new() sets nil for every key

h1 = Hash.new(0)
h1[:count] += 1
puts "#{h1[:count]}"
# output
# 1

puts "#{h1[:new_key]}"
# output
# 0

h2 = {}
h2[:count] += 1
# error
"undefined method `+` for nil:NilClass"
```

## How to sort a Hash

```ruby
hash = {e: 2, d: 3, c: 5, b: 7, a: 11}
hash.sort
# output
# [[:a, 11], [:b, 7], [:c, 5], [:d, 3], [:e, 2]]

hash.sort_by { |k, v| k }
# output
# [[:a, 11], [:b, 7], [:c, 5], [:d, 3], [:e, 2]]

hash.sort_by { |k, v| v }
# output
# [[:e, 2], [:d, 3], [:c, 5], [:b, 7], [:a, 11]]
```

## How to get the maximum from a Hash

```ruby
hash = {e: 2, d: 3, c: 5, b: 7, a: 11}
hash.max_by { |k, v| v }
# output
# [:a, 11]
```

# Loop

The loops in Ruby are :

1. while loop
2. for loop
3. do..while loop
4. until loop

## while loop

The condition which is to be tested, given at the beginning of the loop
and all statements are executed until the given boolean condition satisfies.
When the condition becomes false, the control will be out from the while loop.
It is also known as Entry Controlled Loop because the condition to be tested
is present at the beginning of the loop body. So basically, while loop is
used when the number of iterations is not fixed in a program.

```ruby
# Ruby program to illustrate 'while' loop

# variable count
count = 4

# using while loop
# here conditional is count i.e. 4
while count >= 1

  # statements to be executed
  puts "Ruby Cheatsheet"
  count = count - 1

  # while loop ends here
end
```

Output

```
Ruby Cheatsheet
Ruby Cheatsheet
Ruby Cheatsheet
Ruby Cheatsheet
```

## for loop

“for” loop has similar functionality as while loop but with different syntax.
for loop is preferred when the number of times loop statements are to be executed
is known beforehand. It iterates over a specific range of numbers.
It is also known as Entry Controlled Loop because the condition to be tested
is present at the beginning of the loop body.

```ruby
# Ruby program to illustrate 'for'
# loop using range as expression

text = "Ruby Cheatsheet"

# using for loop with the range
for count in 1..5 do

  puts text

end

```

Output

```
Ruby Cheatsheet
Ruby Cheatsheet
Ruby Cheatsheet
Ruby Cheatsheet
Ruby Cheatsheet
```

## do..while Loop

do while loop is similar to while loop with the only difference that
it checks the condition after executing the statements, i.e it will
execute the loop body one time for sure. It is a Exit-Controlled loop
because it tests the condition which presents at the end of the loop body.

```ruby
# Ruby program to illustrate 'do..while'loop

# starting of do..while loop
loop do

  puts "Ruby Cheatsheet"

  val = '7'

  # using boolean expressions
  if val == '7'
    break
  end

  # ending of ruby do..while loop
end
```

Output

```
Ruby Cheatsheet
```

## until Loop

Ruby until loop will executes the statements or code till the given
condition evaluates to true. Basically it’s just opposite to the while
loop which executes until the given condition evaluates to false.
An until statement’s conditional is separated from code by the
reserved word do, a newline, or a semicolon.

```ruby
var = 7

# using until loop
# here do is optional
until var == 11 do

  # code to be executed
  puts var * 10
  var = var + 1

  # here loop ends
end
```

Output

```
70
80
90
100
```

## How to break out from loop

**break** terminates the most internal loop.
Terminates a method with an associated block
if called within the block (with the method returning nil).

```ruby
# by using break keyword
salary = [399, 234, 566, 533, 233]
salary.each do |s|
  break if s == 566

  puts s
end
#output
# 399
# 234
```

## How to skip inside a loop

```ruby
# by using next keyword
salary = [399, 234, 566, 533, 233]
salary.each do |s|
  next if s == 533

  puts s
end
# output
# 399
# 234
# 566
# 233
```

## How to repeat the current iteration

```ruby
data = [456, 3000]
retry_count = 0
status = "network failure"
sum = 0
data.each do |d|
    if retry_count == 3
        status = "connection established"
        retry_count = 0
        redo
    elsif status == "network failure" and retry_count < 5
        puts "network failure #{retry_count}"
        retry_count += 1
        redo
    elsif status == "connection established"
        puts d
        sum += d
    end
end

# output of sum
# 3456
```

## How to restart a loop

```ruby
numbers = [2, 2, 44, 44]
sum = 0
begin
    numbers.each do |s|
        if rand(1..10) == 5
            puts "hi 5, let's do it again!"
            sum = 0
            raise "hi 5"
        end
        puts s
        sum += s
    end
rescue
    retry
end
```

# Classes

```ruby
class Person
    # when you create a new object, it looks for a method named initialize and executes it, like a constructor in java
    # def initialize(name, number)
    #    @name = name
    #    @number = number
    # end

    # instance variable
    # @name

    # class variable
    # @@count

    # attr_accessor acts as a getter and setter for the following instance attributes
    attr_accessor :name, :number

    # class variable must be initialized
    @@count = 0

    def self.count
        @@count
    end

    def self.count=(count)
        @@count = count
    end

    def initialize
        @@count += 1
    end
end

# create an instance of the Person class
p1 = Person.new

# set attributes of the Person class
p1.name = "Yukihiro Matsumoto"
p1.number = 9999999999

# get attributes of the Person class
puts "#{p1.name}"
puts "#{p1.number}"
puts "#{Person.count}"

# Yukihiro Matsumoto
# 9999999999
# 1

p2 = Person.new
p2.name = "Yukihiro Matsumoto"
p2.number = 9999999999

# get attributes of the Person class
puts "#{p2.name}"
puts "#{p2.number}"
puts "#{Person.count}"

# Yukihiro Matsumoto
# 9999999999
# 2

# set class variable
Person.count = 3
puts "#{Person.count}"
# 3
```

## How to inherit a class

```ruby
class Person
    attr_accessor :name, :number
end

# use < symbol to inherit methods and attributes from the parent class
class Student < Person
    attr_accessor :id
end

s = Student.new

s.name = "James Bond"
s.number = 700
s.id = 678

puts "#{s.name}"
James Bond

puts "#{s.number}"
700

puts "#{s.id}"
678
```

## How to check instance type

```ruby
# Returns true if the object is an instance of the given class, not a subclass or superclass
class Vehicle; end
class Car < Vehicle; end
class Audi < Car; end

car = Car.new
car.instance_of? Vehicle
false
car.instance_of? Car
true
car.instance_of? Audi
false

a = 7
a.instance_of? Integer
true
a.instance_of? Numeric
false
```

## Print all method names of a class

```ruby
puts (String.methods).sort
# Exclude methods that are inherited from Object class
puts (String.methods - Object.public_instance_methods).sort
```

## Check if a Class has a particular method

```ruby
String.respond_to?(:prepend)
true
String.respond_to?(:append)
false
```

# Modules

Modules are used for combining similar methods, so that other classes or modules can use it. You can not instantiate a module (like abstract classes in Java)

```ruby
module MyRandomHelper
    def roll_dice
      rand(1..6)
    end
end

class Person
    attr_accessor :name, :number
end

class Player < Person
    include MyRandomHelper
    attr_accessor :score
end

p = Player.new
p.roll_dice
```

```ruby
TODO
```

# Operator Overloading

```ruby
class Vector
    attr_accessor :x, :y

     def initialize(x, y)
        @x = x
        @y = y
    end

    def +(second)
        Vector.new(@x + second.x, @y + second.y)
    end

    def -(second)
        Vector.new(@x - second.x, @y - second.y)
    end

    def *(second)
        Vector.new(@x * second.x, @y * second.y)
    end

    def /(second)
        Vector.new(@x / second.x, @y / second.y)
    end

    def to_s
        return "(#{@x}, #{@y})"
    end

end
```

```ruby
v1 = Vector.new(5, 10)
v2 = Vector.new(4, 9)

puts v1 + v2
puts v1 - v2
puts v1 * v2
puts v1 / v2
```

# Exception Handling

```ruby
begin
    puts 'before the raise'
    raise 'raise an exception'
    puts 'after the raise'
rescue
    puts 'rescued'
end
```

```ruby
begin
    raise StandardError, 'standard error occurred'
rescue StandardError => e
    puts "#{e.class}: #{e.message}"
    puts e.backtrace.inspect
end
```

`$!` contains the raised exception
`$@` contains the exception backtrace

```ruby
begin
    raise StandardError, 'standard error occurred'
rescue StandardError
    puts "#{$!.class}: #{$!.message}"
    puts "#{$@}"
end
```

`retry` re-executes the code inside begin end block

```ruby
retry_count = 1

begin
    puts "retry count: #{retry_count}"
    retry_count += 1
    raise 'raise an exception'
rescue
    retry if retry_count <= 5
end
```

Custom exception

```ruby
class MyException < Exception
end

begin
    raise MyException, 'my exception occurred'
rescue MyException
    puts "#{$!.class}: #{$!.message}"
    puts "#{$@}"
end
```

Catch multiple exceptions

```ruby
begin
    raise 'i am a string'.call
rescue NoMethodError => e
    puts "#{$!.class}: #{$!.message}"
rescue ZeroDivisionError => e
    puts "#{$!.class}: #{$!.message}"
end

```

a = "Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without"
a[/(\w+)/]

# output
# "Better"

a[/(\w+) (\w+)/]

# output
# "Better a"

a[/(?<one>\w+) (?<two>\w+)/, :two]

# Miscellaneous

## How to generate random number

```ruby
rand(max=0)

# when calling it without an argument, rand returns a floating point number between 0.0 (including) and 1.0 (excluding), under the hood max.to_i.abs == 0
rand

# output
# 0.055758056734957595

# when the argument value is greater than or equal to 1, rand returns a integer between 0 (including) and that number (excluding), under the hood max.to_i.abs >= 1
rand(100)

# output
# 7

# generating number between 2 numbers both inclusive
rand(150..170)

# output
# 167

# generating number between 2 numbers, the last number is not inclusive
rand(1...10)

# output
# 4
```

## Check the syntax of a Ruby file

```ruby
ruby -c filename.rb
```

## Concatenate String in a loop

```ruby
words = ["Lorem", "ipsum", "dolor", "sit", "amet"]
words.map { |word| word.downcase }.join(' ')

# output
# "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
```

## CamelCase String split

```ruby
sentence = "ThereIsNoSpoon"
words = sentence.split(/(?=[A-Z])/)

# output
# ["There", "Is", "No", "Spoon"]
